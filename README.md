Software Engineering Immersive - Project 1 - Frogger

Project: Build a functional Frogger clone in a week.

Technologies Used

1. Javascript
2. CSS
3. HTML

Lessons Learnt

1. Google is your best friend; you still need to ask the right questions.
2. Be mindful of integer values and setting limits.
3. There is always a more elegant way to accomplish the goal; 75% of this can be shortened.

Improvements for the Future

1. Use a tile set and sprites.
2. Use canvas method in HTML instead of controlling via classes and listening for intersecting / non-intersecting classes.
3. Clean up the code; this can be done in way fewer lines.
4. Each tick of the setInterval is very large (1000ms); movement after the calculation is done but before it animates will result in falling off the floating object.
5. Multi-player or against an AI trained with machine learning (using a recursive algorithm).
