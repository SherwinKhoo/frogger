Software Engineering Immersive - Project 1 - Frogger

Project: Build a functional Frogger-type game in a week.

Frogger is an arcade action game developed by Konami. The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one, by crossing a busy road and navigating a river with obstacles.

Technologies Used

1. Javascript
2. CSS
3. HTML

Motivation

1. Reinforce understanding of Javascript, CSS and HTML.
2. Add to portfolio.
3. Being a "gamer, and having played computer games that someone else made since the 90s, it's nice to finally create one for a change, albeit a clone of a classic game.

Approach Taken

1. Build a grid.
   Created with Javascript instead of hardcoded into the HTML.
   Parameters to control number of "pixels" and individual "pixel" size.
   Makes furture grid changes easier.

2. Add **classes** to all "pixels".
   Makes life a lot easier when watching the classes change with each tick of setInterval().
   Use of **loops** and mathematical formulae to calculate row and column positions.
   Rows calculated first => numerator of the result of total "pixels" divided by width.
   Columns calculated after => remainder of the result of total "pixels" divided by width.

3. Use a **switch cases** to determine if movement via arrow keys are valid for the current position.
   Restricts movement to valid "pixels".

4. Assign further classes as specific identifiers.
   Used to call in specific images.
   For example, which "pixel" should show a frog, and which should show a turtle.

5. Use **setInterval()** to control game mechanics, with varying ticks for different purposes.
   Create a countdown timer.
   Move assets such as vehicles and "floating" objects.
   Listen for an end game condition.

6. Determine "collision" mechanics.
   Check if an element has two specific classes.
   Check if an element has a specific class but not another class.

7. Determine end game conditions.
   Build upon the collision mechanics.
   Use **callback functions**.
   Freeze the game with **clearInterval()** when an end condition is met.

Lessons Learnt

1. Setting initial integer values and setting limits for said values.
2. There is always a more elegant solution; 75% of this can be shortened.
3. Using classes only creates the illusion of animation; it doesn't seem to be the most efficient way to handle animation.

Improvements for the Future

1. Time bar instead of a counter.
2. New levels with additional assets.
3. Game "paused" at the start; start triggered by player.
4. Multi-player or against an AI trained with machine learning (recursive algorithm?).
