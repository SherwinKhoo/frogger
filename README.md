Software Engineering Immersive - Project 1 - Frogger

Project: Build a functional Frogger-type game in a week.

Frogger is an arcade action game developed by Konami. The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one, by crossing a busy road and navigating a river with obstacles.

Technologies Used

1. Javascript
2. CSS
3. HTML

Lessons Learnt

1. Setting initial integer values and setting limits for said values.
2. There is always a more elegant way to accomplish the goal; 75% of this can be shortened.
3. Using classes doesn't seem like the most efficient way to handle animation.

Improvements for the Future

1. Time bar instead of a counter.
2. Multiple lives.
3. New levels with additional assets.
4. Game "paused" at the start; start triggered by player.
5. Multi-player or against an AI trained with machine learning (recursive algorithm?).
